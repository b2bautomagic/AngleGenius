		<p>The more potential clients to whom you show a good offer, the more appointments you set with them and ultimately, the more deals (and sales) you close.</p>
		<p>However, I've come across thousands of B2B companies struggling to sell products and services that are indistinguishable from their rivals. This leads to competing on price because, commodities, sell chiefly on price.</p>
		<p>Many such companies are experiencing this difficulty because they are uncertain about (1) what results they can guarantee their clients and (2) why any client should do business with them over their rivals.</p>
